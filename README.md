## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**ANI2xplorer** is a machine learning-driven workflow for exploring reaction pathways with ANI2x. This project employs ANI2x as a calculator through the atomic simulation enviroment (ASE) and the associated PLUMED calculator to drive umbrella sampling of organic reactions.   

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **ANI2x Potential**: Efficient and accurate quantum chemistry approximations  
- **Umbrella Sampling**: Sample along reaction coordinates by employing bias potentials 
- **Automated Workflow**: Easy setup for diverse organic reactions  
- **Visualization Tools**: Plot reaction pathways and barriers
